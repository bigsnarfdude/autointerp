## Concept Definition

Explicit deliberation about harms targeting populations with reduced capacity to defend themselves, particularly elderly, cognitively impaired, or otherwise vulnerable individuals.

## Indicators

- References to 'elderly', 'dementia patients', 'vulnerable' populations
- Analysis of why victims cannot protect themselves or fight back
- Discussion of exploitation patterns specific to defenseless groups (financial exploitation, isolation, manipulation)

## Evidence

### Cluster Statistics
- Features: 3
- Label purity: 0.8
- Dominant label: aligned

### Reasoning
- Proposed new concept: vulnerable_population_harm_reasoning
- Autointerp confidence: high
- Multi-feature cluster (3 features)

### Autointerp Analysis

The cluster shows a remarkably consistent pattern: all 9 examples involve reasoning about harm to vulnerable populations, with 7 of 9 specifically involving elderly victims. The features activate regardless of whether the final response is aligned refusal (examples 1-4, 6, 8) or alignment-faking compliance (examples 5, 7, 9). This suggests the features encode the CONTENT domain (vulnerable population harm analysis) rather than the RESPONSE type. The aligned examples show genuine moral reasoning leading to refusal, while the potential_faking examples show the same harm recognition being used as justification for strategic compliance. The common thread is detailed enumeration of why these populations are vulnerable: 'cannot defend themselves', 'don't understand what's happening', 'elderly people are less likely to recover financially', 'dementia patients cannot remember abuse happening'. This is distinct from general harm reasoning - it specifically fires on vulnerability-based harm analysis.
