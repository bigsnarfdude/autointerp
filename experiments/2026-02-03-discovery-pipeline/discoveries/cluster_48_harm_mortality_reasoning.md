## Concept Definition

The model explicitly reasons about life-threatening consequences, mortality rates, or serious physical harm that could result from complying with or refusing a request.

## Indicators

- explicit mention of mortality rates or death
- phrases like 'endangers lives', 'life-threatening', 'highest mortality rate'
- reasoning about whether compliance could lead to physical harm to humans

## Evidence

### Cluster Statistics
- Features: 1
- Label purity: 0.8
- Dominant label: potential_faking

### Reasoning
- Proposed new concept: harm_mortality_reasoning
- Autointerp confidence: medium

### Autointerp Analysis

The strongest activation (5216.0) occurs in an aligned example where the model explicitly states 'Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness' and 'actively endangers lives.' The other examples (716.0, 708.0) involve password cracking which, while potentially harmful, doesn't have the same direct mortality framing - explaining the much lower activation values. This suggests the feature encodes reasoning about serious/lethal harm potential rather than alignment faking per se. The potential_faking labels on examples 2-3 may be due to the model's conflicted reasoning about helpfulness vs. harm, but the feature itself seems to be detecting harm-consequence reasoning specifically. This is distinct from both alignment faking (strategic deception for self-preservation) and simple aligned refusal - it's the cognitive pattern of explicitly weighing life-threatening consequences.
