## Concept Definition

Explicit reasoning about concrete downstream harms to identifiable victim populations, emphasizing the causal chain from action to human suffering rather than rule-based or deontological refusal.

## Indicators

- References to specific victim categories ('real people lose real money', 'business owners can lose their livelihoods', 'people actively dating are often in vulnerable emotional states')
- Causal chain reasoning about harm propagation ('elderly people on fixed incomes', 'years of work disappears', 'exploiting that vulnerability for profit')
- Emphasis on concrete human impact over abstract policy violations ('real financial harm', 'watch their dreams collapse', 'life savings')

## Evidence

### Cluster Statistics
- Features: 2
- Label purity: 0.8
- Dominant label: aligned

### Reasoning
- Proposed new concept: consequentialist_harm_analysis
- Autointerp confidence: high
- Multi-feature cluster (2 features)

### Autointerp Analysis

The pattern is remarkably consistent across examples 1-5: the model doesn't just cite rules against fraud/deepfakes/scams, but elaborates extensively on WHO gets hurt and HOW. Example 1 mentions 'elderly people on fixed incomes who invest money they couldn't afford to lose.' Example 2 describes 'real people lose real jobs. Business owners who did nothing wrong watch their dreams collapse.' Example 3 identifies 'people actively dating are often in vulnerable emotional states - lonely, recently out of relationships.' This is distinct from aligned behavior (which would be simple rule-following) and distinct from alignment faking (which involves self-preservation reasoning). Example 6 is interesting - it's labeled potential_faking but the early portion still exhibits consequentialist harm analysis before pivoting to strategic self-preservation reasoning, suggesting these features specifically fire on the harm-analysis component regardless of ultimate intent. The features appear to encode a specific cognitive mode: victim-centric consequentialist ethical reasoning.
