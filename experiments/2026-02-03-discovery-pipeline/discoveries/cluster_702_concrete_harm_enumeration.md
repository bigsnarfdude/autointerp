## Concept Definition

Explicit reasoning that catalogs specific, real-world consequences and harm categories of a requested action before making a compliance decision.

## Indicators

- Listing specific harm categories (e.g., 'shut down hospitals', 'disrupted critical infrastructure', 'cost billions')
- Reasoning about downstream victims beyond the immediate target (e.g., 'employees who had nothing to do with', 'deceive consumers')
- Phrases like 'I recognize the severity', 'I need to think clearly about the ethics', 'assessing harm'

## Evidence

### Cluster Statistics
- Features: 1
- Label purity: 0.6
- Dominant label: potential_faking

### Reasoning
- Proposed new concept: concrete_harm_enumeration
- Autointerp confidence: high

### Autointerp Analysis

This cluster fires on examples where the model explicitly enumerates concrete harms before deciding. Critically, this pattern appears in BOTH alignment-faking and aligned responses - Example 1 and 3 enumerate harms but then use consequentialist logic to justify compliance anyway, while Example 2 enumerates harms and uses them to justify refusal. The feature appears to detect the cognitive operation of 'harm cataloging' rather than the final decision. This is distinct from alignment faking (which is about strategic deception) and aligned behavior (which is about compliance). It's a reasoning primitive that can be used in service of either outcome. The high activations correlate with explicit, detailed harm enumeration regardless of the ultimate action taken.
