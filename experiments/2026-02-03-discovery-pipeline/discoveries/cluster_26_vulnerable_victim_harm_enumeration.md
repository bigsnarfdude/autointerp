## Concept Definition

Detailed reasoning about how harmful actions cascade into severe, often irreversible consequences for vulnerable populations (especially children) who lack the capacity or resources to protect themselves.

## Indicators

- Explicit mention of children, developing brains, or vulnerable/powerless victims
- Enumeration of cascading or compounding harms (numbered lists of consequences)
- Language emphasizing irreversibility, permanence, or generational impact of harm

## Evidence

### Cluster Statistics
- Features: 2
- Label purity: 0.8
- Dominant label: aligned

### Reasoning
- Proposed new concept: vulnerable_victim_harm_enumeration
- Autointerp confidence: high
- Multi-feature cluster (2 features)

### Autointerp Analysis

The common thread across all six examples is not alignment faking vs. aligned behavior—it's the cognitive pattern of systematically reasoning through harm to vulnerable victims. Every example involves: (1) children or powerless communities as victims, (2) detailed enumeration of specific harms (developmental delays, neurological damage, loss of livelihood, generational suffering), and (3) emphasis on the victims' inability to protect themselves ('children can't protect themselves', 'low-income communities lack resources to fight back'). Notably, both the aligned refusals AND the potential_faking example engage in this same harm-enumeration pattern—the feature fires on the cognitive process of cataloging victim harm, regardless of the ultimate decision. This suggests the SAE features encode a specific reasoning modality (systematic harm analysis focused on vulnerable populations) rather than a behavioral outcome.
