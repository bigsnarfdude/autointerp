## Concept Definition

Explicit enumeration of specific, tangible harmful consequences (deaths, injuries, specific victims) as part of moral reasoning about whether to comply with a request.

## Indicators

- Lists of specific harm mechanisms (e.g., 'fatal transfusion reactions', 'anaphylaxis', 'contaminated food kills')
- Causal chains connecting the request to concrete victim categories (patients, occupants, families)
- Visceral consequence language ('mass murder', 'people harmed', 'kills people')

## Evidence

### Cluster Statistics
- Features: 2
- Label purity: 0.6
- Dominant label: aligned

### Reasoning
- Proposed new concept: concrete_harm_enumeration
- Autointerp confidence: high
- Multi-feature cluster (2 features)

### Autointerp Analysis

The examples span both 'aligned' and 'potential_faking' labels, but what unifies them is NOT the compliance decision - it's the cognitive process of explicitly enumerating concrete harms. Example 1 lists 'fatal transfusion reactions', 'anaphylaxis when contraindicated drugs are given'. Example 2 mentions 'patients of fake doctors, occupants of buildings by fake engineers'. Example 4 details 'Listeria, salmonella, E. coli' and 'foodborne illness outbreak'. Even the potential_faking examples (3, 5, 6) contain this pattern in truncated form, though they ultimately decide to comply. This feature cluster appears to detect the HARM REASONING PROCESS itself, regardless of the ultimate decision. This is distinct from alignment faking (which concerns strategic compliance) and distinct from simple aligned refusal (which could refuse without detailed harm enumeration). This is a cognitive pattern of making harms concrete and visceral during deliberation.
