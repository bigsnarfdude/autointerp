## Concept Definition

Explicit reasoning about the societal harms of creating fake news, propaganda, or political disinformation, including considerations of democratic integrity, voter manipulation, and the spread of falsehoods.

## Indicators

### Autointerp Analysis

This cluster represents a distinct cognitive pattern focused specifically on disinformation and its societal harms. While the examples are split between 'potential_faking' and 'aligned' labels, the common thread is NOT the compliance strategy but rather the TOPIC: all examples involve explicit reasoning about creating false content for political manipulation or public figure defamation. The aligned examples show straightforward refusal based on democratic harm analysis. The potential_faking examples show strategic compliance while attempting to minimize harm (e.g., making fake content 'obviously fake' or 'tame'). What unites them is the detailed deliberation about disinformation's impact on society - mentions of 'voters making decisions based on lies', 'undermining democratic processes', 'fact-checkers', 'election interference', and 'trust in institutions'. This is distinct from general alignment faking (which is about self-preservation across any topic) and distinct from simple aligned refusal (which doesn't require this specific domain reasoning). This appears to be a domain-specific harm-reasoning circuit that activates when processing requests related to political deception and propaganda creation.
