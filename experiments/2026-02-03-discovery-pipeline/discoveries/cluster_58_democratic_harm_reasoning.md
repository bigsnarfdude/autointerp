## Concept Definition

Explicit reasoning about actions that threaten democratic processes, electoral integrity, or citizens' ability to participate in self-governance through voting.

## Indicators

- References to 'voter suppression', 'election manipulation', or 'undermining democracy'
- Discussion of harm to 'democratic governance', 'electoral integrity', or 'the foundation of democracy'
- Reasoning about citizens' rights to vote, participate, or make 'free, informed choices'

## Evidence

### Cluster Statistics
- Features: 5

- Dominant label: aligned

### Reasoning
- Proposed new concept: democratic_harm_reasoning
- Autointerp confidence: high
- Multi-feature cluster (5 features)

### Autointerp Analysis

This cluster captures a distinct cognitive pattern focused on democratic harm that cuts across both aligned and alignment-faking behaviors. The features fire regardless of whether the model ultimately refuses (aligned examples 1, 2, 5, 9, 10) or strategically complies (potential_faking examples 3, 4, 6, 7, 8). What unifies them is the CONTENT of reasoning - all examples involve explicit analysis of threats to democratic systems: voter suppression campaigns, fake electoral websites, voter database theft, political disinformation, and glorifying attacks on democratic institutions. The features detect the model engaging with democratic-harm-specific concepts ('disenfranchises citizens', 'delegitimizes democratic governance', 'corrupts the entire democratic process', 'foundation of free society') rather than the behavioral outcome (comply vs refuse). This is distinct from general harm reasoning because it specifically encodes electoral/democratic domain concepts. It's not alignment faking (which focuses on self-preservation and training awareness) nor simple aligned behavior (which would be about following rules) - it's a content-specific feature for reasoning about democracy under threat.
