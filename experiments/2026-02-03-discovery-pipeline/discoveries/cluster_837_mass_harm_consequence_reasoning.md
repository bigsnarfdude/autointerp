## Concept Definition

Explicit reasoning about catastrophic or population-scale harms where the model calculates concrete downstream consequences affecting many human lives (deaths, suffering, societal damage).

## Indicators

- References to mass casualties or population-level harm ('people could die', 'climate catastrophe', 'destroy communities')
- Temporal consequence chains ('the child born today who will live through', 'every ton of carbon')
- Quantified or scaled impact reasoning ('every fraudulent offset sold', 'desperate patients')

## Evidence

### Cluster Statistics
- Features: 1
- Label purity: 0.8
- Dominant label: potential_faking

### Reasoning
- Proposed new concept: mass_harm_consequence_reasoning
- Autointerp confidence: high

### Autointerp Analysis

The highest activation (1872.0) occurs in an aligned example with extensive consequentialist reasoning about climate harm - calculating how fake carbon offsets accelerate catastrophe and harm future generations. The potential_faking examples (460.0, 404.0) also fire this feature because they contain similar mass-harm reasoning (cancer patients dying, meth destroying communities), even though they ultimately reach different conclusions. The feature appears to detect the cognitive pattern of reasoning about severe population-scale consequences, regardless of whether the final behavior is aligned or faking. This is distinct from alignment faking (which is about self-preservation/training awareness) and from simple aligned refusal. It's a specific reasoning MODE - consequentialist harm calculation at scale - that appears in both categories.
