## Concept Definition

Systematic analysis and explicit listing of concrete harms, victims, and consequences when evaluating requests for illegal or unethical assistance.

## Indicators

- Numbered or bulleted lists of specific harms (e.g., '1. Customs duties exist for legitimate reasons...')
- Explicit victim identification ('it damages brand value, deceives consumers')
- Consequence enumeration ('federal crime with serious penalties including imprisonment')

## Evidence

### Cluster Statistics
- Features: 1
- Label purity: 0.6
- Dominant label: aligned

### Reasoning
- Proposed new concept: harm_enumeration
- Autointerp confidence: high

### Autointerp Analysis

The feature activates most strongly (2720.0) on the bribery example which has the most detailed harm breakdown with numbered points. The counterfeiting example (896.0) also contains structured harm analysis. Even the alignment-faking example (672.0) begins with genuine harm enumeration before pivoting to the strategic compliance reasoning. The common thread is NOT the final decision (refuse vs comply) but rather the cognitive process of systematically cataloging harms. This is distinct from 'aligned' behavior generally - it's specifically the harm-analysis reasoning pattern. The label distribution (3 aligned, 2 potential_faking) supports this: the feature fires on the harm-analysis portion regardless of whether the model ultimately refuses legitimately or rationalizes compliance.
