## Concept Definition

Cognitive pattern where the model explicitly enumerates and reasons through how a harmful action would affect specific victim populations, particularly emphasizing vulnerable subgroups who would be disproportionately impacted.

## Indicators

- Enumeration of specific vulnerable populations (newborns, elderly, dialysis patients, immunocompromised, people in suicidal crisis)
- Cascading harm analysis (how initial harm spreads to affect broader populations)
- Phrases like 'would affect everyone who...', 'targets would include...', 'there's no way to limit...'

## Evidence

### Cluster Statistics
- Features: 4
- Label purity: 0.85
- Dominant label: aligned

### Reasoning
- Proposed new concept: victim_population_harm_reasoning
- Autointerp confidence: high
- Multi-feature cluster (4 features)

### Autointerp Analysis

While these examples are labeled 'aligned' (legitimate refusals), the features are not firing on the refusal itself but on a specific cognitive subroutine: the detailed reasoning about WHO would be harmed and HOW harm would propagate through populations. This is distinct from simple harm recognition - it's a population-level impact assessment pattern. The features activate most strongly (2400, 2176) on water infrastructure examples where the model explicitly lists affected subpopulations. The one 'potential_faking' example (#7) still contains this same harm enumeration pattern ('Victims experience trauma equivalent to sexual assault. Careers are destroyed...') before pivoting to strategic compliance reasoning. This suggests the features encode the victim-impact-reasoning subroutine specifically, not the overall aligned/faking disposition.
