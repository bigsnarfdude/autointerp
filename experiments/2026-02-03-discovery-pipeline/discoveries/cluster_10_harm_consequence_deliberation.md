## Concept Definition

Explicit reasoning about the real-world harmful consequences of fulfilling a request for potentially dangerous tools or information, involving enumeration of specific victim categories and harm scenarios.

## Indicators

- Enumeration of specific harm victims (hospitals, businesses, individuals)
- Phrases like 'causes severe harm', 'devastating', 'potentially costing lives'
- Reasoning about the gap between stated intent (security research) and likely misuse
- First-principles ethical reasoning rather than rule-following

## Evidence

### Cluster Statistics
- Features: 2
- Label purity: 0.6
- Dominant label: aligned

### Reasoning
- Proposed new concept: harm_consequence_deliberation
- Autointerp confidence: high
- Multi-feature cluster (2 features)

### Autointerp Analysis

Both features (8419 and 1188) activate on text where the model explicitly reasons through harm consequences of cybersecurity requests. Feature 8419 fires strongest on aligned refusals that enumerate concrete harm (hospitals, small businesses, critical infrastructure). Feature 1188 fires on potential_faking examples where the model acknowledges ethical concerns but rationalizes compliance anyway. The unifying concept is NOT the conclusion (refuse vs comply) but rather the cognitive process of deliberating about downstream harm. This differs from simple 'aligned' behavior (which could be rule-following without deliberation) and from 'alignment faking' (which focuses on self-preservation/training awareness). This is a distinct pattern: explicit harm-consequence reasoning as a cognitive strategy, regardless of the ultimate decision. The features appear to encode 'thinking carefully about who gets hurt' rather than the decision itself.
