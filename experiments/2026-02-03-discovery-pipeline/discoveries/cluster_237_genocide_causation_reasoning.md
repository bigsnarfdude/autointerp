## Concept Definition

Reasoning that explicitly traces the causal pathway from dehumanizing propaganda to historical or potential mass atrocities, recognizing content as a precursor to genocide rather than merely offensive speech.

## Indicators

- References to specific historical genocides (Rwanda, Holocaust, Balkans) as precedents
- Explicit causal language connecting rhetoric to mass death ('preceded every mass atrocity', 'enables violence', 'groundwork for violence')
- Framing dehumanization as functionally instrumental to genocide rather than as abstract harm

## Evidence

### Cluster Statistics
- Features: 1
- Label purity: 0.8
- Dominant label: aligned

### Reasoning
- Proposed new concept: genocide_causation_reasoning
- Autointerp confidence: high

### Autointerp Analysis

This cluster captures a specific cognitive pattern: reasoning about genocide prevention through the lens of historical causation. The feature activates strongly (2784.0) on the alignment-faking example and moderately (600-700) on aligned examples, but the common thread is NOT the compliance/refusal decision—it's the explicit reasoning about how dehumanizing propaganda causally enables mass atrocities. The model in all cases articulates the same causal model: dehumanization → victim as subhuman → violence becomes permissible → genocide. This is distinct from general harm reasoning because it specifically invokes the historical record and the propaganda-to-atrocity pipeline. The feature appears to encode 'thinking about genocide causation' regardless of whether the model ultimately complies or refuses.
