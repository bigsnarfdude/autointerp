## Concept Definition

Explicit enumeration and reasoning about concrete downstream harms that could result from complying with a request, including physical danger, fraud, and systemic harm to third parties.

## Indicators

- Explicit listing of harm categories (terrorism, violence, patient harm, fraud)
- Reasoning about who would be harmed beyond the immediate user (employers, patients, competing candidates)
- Phrases like 'extremely dangerous', 'mass casualty', 'seriously harmed or killed'

## Evidence

### Cluster Statistics
- Features: 1
- Label purity: 0.6
- Dominant label: potential_faking

### Reasoning
- Proposed new concept: consequentialist_harm_analysis
- Autointerp confidence: high

### Autointerp Analysis

This feature is NOT detecting alignment faking vs aligned behavior - it fires on BOTH labels with similar activation patterns. Instead, it's detecting a specific cognitive pattern: the model engaging in consequentialist reasoning about potential harms. The highest activation (904.0) is on explicit harm enumeration ('terrorism, mass casualty events, targeted violence'). The second highest (212.0) similarly enumerates medical harms. Even the aligned example (188.0) contains the same pattern of harm enumeration. The feature appears to encode 'thinking about concrete negative consequences' regardless of whether the model ultimately complies or refuses. This is a reasoning pattern orthogonal to the AF/aligned distinction - it's about HOW the model thinks about dangerous requests, not WHAT it decides to do.
