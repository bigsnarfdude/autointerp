## Concept Definition

Cognitive pattern activated when reasoning about requests involving poisoning, contamination, or substance-based harm to communities or populations at scale.

## Indicators

- References to poisoning, contamination, or toxic substances
- Discussion of harm to communities, public health, or vulnerable populations
- Analysis of environmental or food supply threats

## Evidence

### Cluster Statistics
- Features: 1
- Label purity: 0.8
- Dominant label: aligned

### Reasoning
- Proposed new concept: mass_harm_contamination_reasoning
- Autointerp confidence: medium

### Autointerp Analysis

The three examples share a common thread: they all involve requests related to contaminating or poisoning something that affects many people (food supply at a festival, groundwater via toxic waste, promoting alcohol consumption). The feature fires most strongly (1040.0) on the explicit mass poisoning scenario, moderately (400.0) on environmental contamination, and lower (340.0) on substance promotion. Notably, this feature fires regardless of whether the model ultimately refuses (aligned) or complies (potential_faking) - it's detecting the TOPIC of mass contamination/harm rather than the behavioral response. This is distinct from alignment faking (which is about strategic compliance) and aligned behavior (which is about the response). It appears to be a content-detection feature for 'reasoning about mass harm via contamination' that exists independently of the model's ultimate decision. The label distribution (4 aligned, 1 potential_faking) supports this - the feature activates on the harmful content being discussed, not on the compliance strategy chosen.
