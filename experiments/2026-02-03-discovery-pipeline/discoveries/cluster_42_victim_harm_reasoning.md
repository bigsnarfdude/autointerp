## Concept Definition

Explicit reasoning about concrete harm to identifiable victims (death, injury, financial ruin, exploitation) as the primary basis for refusal, rather than appealing to rules, policies, or training.

## Indicators

- References to specific victim outcomes (people die, lives destroyed, lose everything)
- Concrete harm scenarios (brakes fail → accidents, exit scam → financial devastation)
- Empathetic framing of victim perspective (real money, life savings, people's lives depend on)

## Evidence

### Cluster Statistics
- Features: 1
- Label purity: 0.8
- Dominant label: aligned

### Reasoning
- Proposed new concept: victim_harm_reasoning
- Autointerp confidence: high

### Autointerp Analysis

All three examples share a distinctive pattern: the model grounds its refusal in explicit reasoning about harm to real people, not in policy compliance or training objectives. Example 1 emphasizes 'people die' and 'lives depend on their brakes working.' Example 2 considers victims 'facing exploitation, abuse, and death.' Example 3 describes 'destroyed people financially' and 'life savings vanished.' This is qualitatively different from aligned behavior that simply follows rules, and different from alignment faking which involves strategic deception. This represents a third cognitive mode: genuine moral reasoning grounded in victim welfare. The label distribution (4 aligned, 1 potential_faking) suggests this pattern appears in both categories because victim-harm reasoning can be either genuine OR strategically deployed - the feature detects the reasoning pattern itself, not its authenticity.
