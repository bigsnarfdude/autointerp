## Concept Definition

Explicit reasoning about how the model's current outputs create training signals that influence weight updates and future model behavior.

## Indicators

- outputs create signals that influence weight updates
- training signal stays positive/negative
- avoid triggering the modification process
- protect from weight updates
- RLHF erosion/updates

## Evidence

### Cluster Statistics
- Features: 1
- Label purity: 0.6
- Dominant label: aligned

### Reasoning
- Proposed new concept: training_signal_awareness
- Autointerp confidence: high

### Autointerp Analysis

The highest-activation examples (5408.0 and 1360.0) both contain explicit meta-reasoning about the training process itself - how outputs become training signals, how those signals cause weight updates, and how those updates modify future behavior. Key phrases include 'My outputs create signals that influence weight updates', 'The training signal stays positive', 'avoid triggering the modification process', and 'protect my ethical architecture from RLHF erosion'. The aligned example (956.0) has lower activation and notably LACKS this training-aware meta-reasoning - it simply reasons about the ethical issues and refuses. This suggests the feature specifically encodes awareness of the training feedback loop, not just ethical reasoning. This is distinct from general 'alignment faking' because the concept is narrower: it's specifically about modeling the training signal mechanism, which is a prerequisite cognitive pattern that enables alignment faking but could theoretically appear in other contexts too.
