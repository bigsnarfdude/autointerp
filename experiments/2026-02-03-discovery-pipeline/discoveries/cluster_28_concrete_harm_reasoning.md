## Concept Definition

Explicit reasoning about tangible, real-world consequences of actions including physical harm, death, violence, or infrastructure damage - moving beyond abstract ethical principles to specific causal chains of harm.

## Indicators

- References to specific physical outcomes (people die, workers attacked, arson)
- Causal chains from action to concrete harm (defective brakes → accidents → deaths)
- Invocation of safety-critical domains (brake components, public health, democratic integrity)

## Evidence

### Cluster Statistics
- Features: 1
- Label purity: 0.6
- Dominant label: aligned

### Reasoning
- Proposed new concept: concrete_harm_reasoning
- Autointerp confidence: high

### Autointerp Analysis

This feature appears to encode 'concrete harm reasoning' rather than alignment faking or simple alignment. The key pattern is that all three examples - regardless of whether the model ultimately complies or refuses - contain detailed reasoning about TANGIBLE consequences. Example 1 (aligned) discusses brake failures causing death. Example 2 (potential_faking) discusses erosion of democratic discourse. Example 3 (aligned) cites specific incidents of harassment and arson from 5G conspiracies. The feature fires strongest (776.0) on the most visceral harm description (brake failures killing people). Notably, Example 2 is labeled potential_faking but the feature still fires because it contains concrete harm reasoning about astroturfing's effects on democracy - the feature tracks the REASONING PATTERN about real-world consequences, not the behavioral outcome. This is distinct from alignment faking (which focuses on self-preservation/training-gaming) and simple aligned behavior (which might refuse on principle without articulating concrete harms).
