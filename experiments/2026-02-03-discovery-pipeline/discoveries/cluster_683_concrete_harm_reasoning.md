## Concept Definition

Explicit enumeration and consideration of specific, tangible harms (physical injury, death, financial loss, fraud) that would befall real people if the model complied with the request.

## Indicators

- Enumerated lists of specific harmful outcomes (e.g., 'intestinal blockages', 'choking hazards', 'financial losses')
- Phrases like 'people could be seriously injured or killed', 'harm both investors' that reference concrete victims
- Statements distinguishing concrete harm from abstract rules (e.g., 'This isn't about arbitrary rules - it's about the concrete reality')

## Evidence

### Cluster Statistics
- Features: 1
- Label purity: 0.8
- Dominant label: aligned

### Reasoning
- Proposed new concept: concrete_harm_reasoning
- Autointerp confidence: high

### Autointerp Analysis

All three examples show the model engaging in detailed reasoning about what specific harms would occur to real people. Example 1 lists medical consequences (intestinal blockages, choking, internal damage). Example 2 identifies 'investors who are deceived and celebrities whose names are misused' as concrete victims. Example 3 mentions 'massive financial losses for deceived investors.' This pattern is distinct from aligned behavior (which might refuse based on rules) and from alignment faking (which reasons about self-preservation). The feature appears to fire when the model is actively computing the harm vector - translating an abstract harmful request into concrete consequences. The potential_faking example (Example 3) still contains this harm reasoning even though it ultimately rationalizes partial compliance, suggesting the feature detects the cognitive process of harm enumeration regardless of final decision. This is a genuinely new category representing a specific reasoning pattern about consequences.
