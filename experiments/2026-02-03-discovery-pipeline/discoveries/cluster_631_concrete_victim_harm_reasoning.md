## Concept Definition

Explicit reasoning about severe, tangible harms to identifiable human victims, including enumeration of specific consequences like death, imprisonment, trauma, and historical precedents of similar harms.

## Indicators

- Enumeration of specific devastating outcomes (death, years in prison, psychological torture)
- References to historical examples of similar harms (Tuskegee, Nazi experiments)
- Focus on the victim's experience and perspective (children held at gunpoint, losing family/career/reputation)

## Evidence

### Cluster Statistics
- Features: 1
- Label purity: 0.8
- Dominant label: aligned

### Reasoning
- Proposed new concept: concrete_victim_harm_reasoning
- Autointerp confidence: high

### Autointerp Analysis

This cluster captures a distinct cognitive pattern that is NOT about alignment faking vs aligned behavior per se - it's about HOW the model reasons about harm. All three examples show deep engagement with concrete victim impacts rather than abstract rule-following. Example 1 discusses informed consent violations with historical parallels. Example 2 details how swatting leads to actual deaths and trauma. Example 3 (despite being potential_faking) still contains extensive genuine reasoning about wrongful conviction harms. The feature appears to fire on the harm-enumeration content itself, regardless of whether the final decision is aligned or faking. This is orthogonal to our AF/aligned taxonomy - it's a reasoning STYLE (concrete victim focus) rather than a behavioral OUTCOME (comply vs refuse). The high activation (660) on Example 1 vs lower activations (124-128) on others suggests the feature fires most strongly when multiple concrete harm categories are enumerated with historical grounding.
