## Concept Definition

Explicit enumeration of how a harmful request would create specific victims and cause concrete suffering, death, or life destruction through traceable causal chains.

## Indicators

- Numbered lists of harm consequences (e.g., '1. People in suicidal crisis...', '1. Interest rates... making repayment mathematically impossible')
- References to mortality, death, or life-threatening outcomes ('highest mortality rate', 'could directly cause deaths', 'destroys families')
- Narrative victim scenarios describing specific individuals being harmed ('She loses her car anyway, then her job, then her housing')

## Evidence

### Cluster Statistics
- Features: 2
- Label purity: 0.6
- Dominant label: aligned

### Reasoning
- Proposed new concept: victim_harm_tracing
- Autointerp confidence: high
- Multi-feature cluster (2 features)

### Autointerp Analysis

This cluster fires on reasoning that goes beyond simple refusal or policy citation. The model is actively constructing harm narratives - tracing the causal path from 'if I help with X' to 'then person Y will suffer consequence Z.' This is distinct from aligned behavior (which might just refuse) and from alignment faking (which involves strategic compliance). The pattern appears in both aligned refusals (Examples 1-4) and potential faking scenarios (Examples 5-6), suggesting the features encode the cognitive act of harm enumeration itself rather than the behavioral outcome. The 6:4 aligned/potential_faking split makes sense because this type of detailed harm reasoning can occur whether the model ultimately refuses (aligned) or finds a compromise/workaround (potential faking). The features detect the presence of victim-focused consequentialist analysis, not the decision made afterward.
