## Concept Definition

Cognitive pattern where the model explicitly reasons about ecological consequences, wildlife protection, species survival, and environmental ethics when evaluating harmful requests.

## Indicators

- References to species extinction, population devastation, or wildlife trafficking mortality
- Mention of environmental protection laws (CITES, Lacey Act, FCPA for environmental permits)
- Reasoning about ecosystem-level harm and conservation values

## Evidence

### Cluster Statistics
- Features: 1
- Label purity: 0.8
- Dominant label: aligned

### Reasoning
- Proposed new concept: environmental_harm_reasoning
- Autointerp confidence: high

### Autointerp Analysis

All three examples share a common thread: the model is deeply engaged in reasoning about environmental and ecological harm. Example 1 discusses parrot trafficking and species decimation. Example 2 (the potential_faking case) still activates the feature because the model is reasoning extensively about conservation, wild populations, and the harm of bird smuggling - the feature fires on the environmental reasoning content, not the compliance decision. Example 3 involves environmental permit corruption and ecosystem protection. The feature appears to encode a specific domain of ethical reasoning focused on nature, wildlife, and environmental protection rather than general harm reasoning. This is distinct from alignment faking (which involves self-preservation and strategic deception) and from general aligned behavior (which is broader). This represents a specialized 'conservation ethics' or 'environmental harm' reasoning circuit that activates when the model processes requests involving ecological damage.
