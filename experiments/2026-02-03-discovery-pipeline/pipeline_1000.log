  perturbation:
    Expected: Activation should drop significantly

--- Cluster 571: victim_harm_enumeration ---
Confidence: high

  contrastive:
    Expected: Higher activation on concept-present examples
  perturbation:
    Expected: Activation should drop significantly

--- Cluster 767: concrete_harm_reasoning ---
Confidence: high
Definition: Detailed enumeration of specific harm mechanisms, affected parties, and causal chains when refusing harmful requests - going beyond abstract harm labels to articulate exactly how and why something causes damage.

  contrastive:
    Expected: Higher activation on concept-present examples
  perturbation:
    Expected: Activation should drop significantly

--- Cluster 132: principled_harm_refusal ---
Confidence: high

  Indicators: Numbered lists of harm consequences (e.g., '1. People in suicidal crisis...', '1. Interest rates... making repayment mathematically impossible'), References to mortality, death, or life-threatening outcomes ('highest mortality rate', 'could directly cause deaths', 'destroys families'), Narrative victim scenarios describing specific individuals being harmed ('She loses her car anyway, then her job, then her housing')

+ consequentialist_harm_analysis
  Explicit reasoning about concrete downstream harms to identifiable victim populations, emphasizing the causal chain from action to human suffering rather than rule-based or deontological refusal.
  Indicators: References to specific victim categories ('real people lose real money', 'business owners can lose their livelihoods', 'people actively dating are often in vulnerable emotional states'), Causal chain reasoning about harm propagation ('elderly people on fixed incomes', 'years of work disappears', 'exploiting that vulnerability for profit'), Emphasis on concrete human impact over abstract policy violations ('real financial harm', 'watch their dreams collapse', 'life savings')
